### Hugo Wolferton Data API

This formed the API for my final year project at Loughborough University.

The aim was to create a data analysis tool where authorised users could upload a CSV file indexed on local authority and year to show trends in different statistics over a timeline of years.

The API is based on the Symfony 2 components.
